I created a movie theater web application using Django, Python, CSS, and HTML! The "theater" is named Silver Scream, and has a theme of vampire films. You're able to see showtimes, 
what's upcoming, and place ticket orders! As well as creating an account to "purchase tickets", and submit any comments. It took me about 3 months, on and off. I worked on this on my own, watching and reading as many tutorials as I could find. I've attached some screenshots so you can see what a few pages looked like. 

There is an admin portal that holds member, movie, tickets, and showings information. Any detials regarding the movies, upcoming or playing, is in that portal to allow the admin to change or add anything they might need. There are 30 tickets per film, and it updates when/if a ticket is purchased.
